# DuckSplasher

A splashing script for the RuneLite client of Old School Runescape that I created while exploring and learning AutoHotKey.

I'm releasing it as I've since moved on from AutoHotKey to Python. 

In the future I may add support for PixelSearch, auto-attack, and auto-login.

# How to use:

Login to your account and start splashing then run this script. Use this to circumvent the logout timer.

In this image I have the top column set from 9-14 minutes, and the bottom to 11-23.

After selecting the variables from the first and second (optional) column, click OK to load them, then press F1.

The second set of variables are optional but act as a sort of anti-ban to make the random algorithm harder to detect.

You can set extra delay and options to minimize RuneLite in the Extra tab aswell as choose to use randomized lowercase letters as input while splashing instead of the default backspace.

I'd recommend using VirtualBox while using this. The script is pretty unobtrusive but you can only run one RuneLite client while it runs.

# Will I get banned?

Cheating on RuneScape *IS* against the rules, so use it at your own risk. However, I've successfully reached 99 magic on 6 accounts while using this script, so I'd say it's doing something right.
